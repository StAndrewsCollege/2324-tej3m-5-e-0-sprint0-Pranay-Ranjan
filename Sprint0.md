## Goal

The goal for this sprint is to make the tallest paper tower possible within a 1-week timeframe

I aim to make the tower 1 meter tall using one of my methods

### Restrictions
We are restricted by what we can use
- One piece of paper 8.5x11 inches 
- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed

## Process

Below is how I tried to make the tallest paper tower possible

### Research

Other classmates: John Qing, Andy Wang, Richard Zhao and Beric Dengler
By observing and conversing with these classmates, I came up with many ideas about how to make a good tower
- Watching others try to build
- Talking to others while planning
- Helping others in their buildings
- Taking inspiration from their buildings
  
Online Research: Reddit & Quora
By reading through some repositories on these platforms, I gained some knowledge and ideas about how I can perfect the design
- Reddit: [R/Physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ss4uz/2_meter_paper_tower_building/)
- Quora: [Quora Repository](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-make-a-paper-tower-with-no-tape-or-glue-just-paper#:~:text=You%20can%20fold%20the%20paper,them%20to%20form%20a%20tower.)

Online Research: Articles & websites
Through articles and websites, I was able to research some preliminary information about possible designs
The articles didn't have much about just paper towers, but I adapted the ideas into my designs

### Ideation
I sketched out 3 possible designs for how my tower will be built after researching and communicating with classmates
I wasn't able to insert the actual sketches into GitHub, but here's a link to all 3 sketches: [Google Doc Sketches](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzYxjMGsE_MSOeL3XgI2k-a83mV3NweI-PS4f6lMASY/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Accordion Method - Online Idea
   - Cut the piece of paper into four equal pages where they are longer horizontally than vertically
   - Make an accordion-like shape: look on google and in sketches, outlined there
   - Stack accoridon shapes on top of each other
  
2. "V" Shapes With Rips - In Class Idea (John Qing & Beric Dengler)
   - Cut the piece of paper into 4 pieces where they are horizontally long with there being a big piece and smaller proceeding pieces
   - Fold the sheets into V shapes: sketches show what they should look like
   - Make small 1cm rips on the top and bottom of the two mid-sized sheets, top rips on the big sheet, and bottom rips on the smallest sheet
   - Insert one side of the rip to the other side of the rip inversely: sketches have what this should look like
   - Balance by moving sheets front and back, side to side, etc. 

3. Cylinders With Ties - In Class Idea (Andy Wang)
   - Cut the sheet of paper into 4 pieces, small to large with horizontal being longer, and one small line of paper
   - roll the sheets into cylinders
   - Insert smaller cylinder into bigger cylinder, and use cut the small line of paper to make a tie to keep the cylinders together
   - Repeat with all 4 pieces
  
### Prototyping

I couldn't take images of the prototypes that I made as I didn't have my phone to take the images, take a look at [sketches](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzYxjMGsE_MSOeL3XgI2k-a83mV3NweI-PS4f6lMASY/edit?usp=sharing) to see ideas but all were made in real life. 

1. Accordion Prototype
   - Prototype was prone to falling
   - Wasn't a viable option for maximum height
   - Fastest way was to fold few times to see if it works, worked fine
     
2. "V" with Rips Prototype
   - Can be built very high (1m+)
   - Hard to balance
   - Hard to get perfect rip/cut
   - Fastest way was to try 2, then 3, then 4, only got to 3 but could get to 4 with more time
     
3. Cylinder Ties Prototype
   - Ties worked well in keeping cylinders together
   - Cylinders could build up high(1.1m+)
   - Ties were a bit tough to make
   - Fastest way was to put together 1-by-1, got to 3 but with a better plan for ties could have been 4 or 5

### Testing and Critique

1. Accordion Prototype
   - Didn't work well in keeping up
   - Needs a new design to be built up higher
   - The pieces could be cut in half vertically to be made double the height
     
2. "V" with Rips Prototype
   - Worked well in keeping up
   - It can be improved with some detailing on the connecting cuts, but that is just because of the prototype issue
   - Could have been a bit thinner in the bottom, could have led to being more sturdy
     
3. Cylinder Ties Prototype
   - Worked best of the three ideas
   - Can be improved by making the ties more efficient, prototype issue
   - The design itself is good to build high, doesn't need to be fixed
   - Going to look to change the tie and how it works, can be more efficient

### Final design

The final design that I am choosing to pursue further is the Cylinder stacking with ties. It showed the most promise without significant improvements needed to make it even better

Steps:
- Take a fresh sheet of paper
- Using scissors or an exacto-knife, cut the piece of paper into straight lines where there is more horizontal distance than vertical
- Cut approximately 4-5 lines this way, leaving a small, thin strip of paper to be used for ties, the 4-5 lines should be: 3.5 in, 3 in, 2.5 in, and 2 in, with the 1 in strip being the thin strip
- Cut the thin strip into 3-4 smaller lines, being able to tie them into knots
- Roll the bigger pieces into cylinders, rolling to make the cylinders as long as possible
- Put a thinner cylinder in the middle of the top hole of a smaller cylinder
- Tie one of the paper ties around this intersection to keep these pieces stable
- Repeat the insert & tie process until all pieces are used
- Stand up the tower, adjusting ties wherever needed
- To avoid errors, make sure that the strips are varying in sizes
- Make sure the ties are strong enough that the paper won't slide

### Conclusion

The final design that I made had success in staying up for 30 seconds and being very tall. It reached a maximum height of 1.02 meters. This success came from lots of research and planning before creating the final product. To be made even better, others can look into thinner cylinders and see if they can keep the building up, since thinner cylinders would result in more cylinders, which would make to tower taller. 
Under the sketches in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzYxjMGsE_MSOeL3XgI2k-a83mV3NweI-PS4f6lMASY/edit?usp=sharing), you can find a photo of what the final product looked like when another person used the same concept idea.
You will make a brief comment on the success of your design and what next steps others might build on your work.
